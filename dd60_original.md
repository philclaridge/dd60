## Historical Context

The DD60 display was part of Seymour Cray's innovative design for the CDC6600, representing cutting-edge display technology of the 1960s. The system was developed with Cray working alongside Jim Thornton, system architect and "hidden genius" of the 6600 [⁶](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_6600).

### Notable Characteristics
- **Whimsical Handwritten Appearance**: The analog circuit response distorted the angular stroke patterns, giving characters a distinctive handwritten look [²](https://www.mail-archive.com/cctalk@classiccmp.org/msg36279.html)
- **Design Authority**: According to Seymour Cray's foreword, "Mr. Thornton was personally responsible for most of the detailed design of the Control Data model 6600 system" [⁷](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102630394)
- **Performance Context**: The CDC 6600 outperformed IBM 7030 Stretch by factor of three, achieving up to 3 megaFLOPS (1964-1969) [⁶](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_6600)

### Observed Display Artifacts (Image Analysis)
Based on analysis of DD60 display screenshot from [CDC console video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcSmUEaCRp8):

- **Non-Uniform Brightness**: Significant brightness variation along stroke paths, brighter at stroke beginnings/ends
- **Stroke Curvature**: Straight strokes show noticeable curvature and S-curves in diagonal lines
- **Phosphor Bloom**: Green phosphor glow extends beyond stroke boundaries with halation effects
- **Beam Settling Artifacts**: Corner transitions show overshoots and rounded corners instead of sharp angles
- **Character Inconsistency**: Same digits display slightly different shapes due to analog variations
- **Phosphor Persistence Effects**: Slight trailing/ghosting visible on stroke edges consistent with P31 phosphor
